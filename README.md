# Foobar Challenge Solutions

This GitHub repository contains solutions to the problems from the Foobar Challenge, an invite-only programming competition organized by Google.

## Project Description

The Foobar Challenge is a set of programming problems designed to test the problem-solving and coding skills of developers. The competition is divided into different levels, with each level consisting of a varying number of challenges. This project aims to provide well-documented, efficient, and clean solutions for each of these problems, along with explanations and walkthroughs to help others learn and understand the concepts behind them.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Level_1/`: Contains solutions for problems in Level 1 of the Foobar Challenge.
- `Level_2/`: Contains solutions for problems in Level 2 of the Foobar Challenge.
- `Level_3/`: Contains solutions for problems in Level 3 of the Foobar Challenge.
- `Level_4/`: Contains solutions for problems in Level 4 of the Foobar Challenge.
- `Level_5/`: Contains solutions for problems in Level 5 of the Foobar Challenge.

Each folder contains subfolders for each problem, which include:

- `README.md`: A detailed explanation of the problem, its requirements, and constraints.
- `solution.py`: A well-documented, efficient, and clean Python solution to the problem.
- `test_cases.py`: A set of test cases to validate the correctness of the solution.
